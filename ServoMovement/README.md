# Servo Movement 

## Added Two Files, First is the ServoMovement.py file and the second one is the global header file which has all the imports

### There are 5 Servos on the Arm IDs 6 through 10 out of which Servos 6 and 10 are specialised.

#### Servo 6 is the base servo used for moving the Arm laterally and Servo 10 is the claw which can be opened or closed to pick or place objects

Need to Add Ros Integration
